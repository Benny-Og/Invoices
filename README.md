<h1>Invoices</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to set up a database and deep dive into the data for a local business. Within this database, we focused on kpi's such as average invoice amount, top paying customers, and sum amount per quarter. This was a great opportunity for me to get hands on experience with real data. At the end, for fun I decided to try and predict the end of Quarter 4 amount since we haven't reached that point yet.
